## Future Improvements

I will add various descriptions to all the spec of cars displayed in the Gallery Section
I will have to optimise the website to stand out among its competitors.

 
## The Technologies I have used
This includes HTML W3Schools, for adhering to the correct HTML syntax
CSS W3Schools for adhering to the correct CSS syntax
 downloads
I used this JS programming for creating some logic to the project work

 
## Validators
I used [HTML]  (https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS]  (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate the web document. 
Minor errors appeared from its content and I made some corrections.

 
## Testing
The logo is displayed in bold colours to the top right of the page.

I am happy to browse through a website that is very easy to navigate through.

As a Car enthusiast, I am glad to visit cars online to learn about trending cars. 

Being a one-page website it is visible and easy to access at any given point in time.
 
At the footer, various Links to the social media network is displayed. 

 
## Home Page
This is the Index page, more so, the landing page once entered it takes the user to all the necessary details of the website.

 
## Header Section
It contains the names of the logo and the different sections of the links and its content.


## Outcome
The website is simple and working well,
At the moment I am taking care of my younger one during the day, While I work during the night and try to study in between.
I am still trying to learn all I could do to become a great Software Engineer.

## Bugs


I am still carrying out some finding to see if there is any potential bug.

Note: I am in a very tight end, due to the previous  shortcoming,
 I have been given three months and some weeks to summit all four project which is not possible, I am a family man, who works to take care of my family, I have explained this to the student care team, but things did not work out, I just have to code or do something irrespective of not having the required time to work on my projects. That is why some you will see some lapse in my work, just because I have not had time to go through various programming subjets and concepts.
